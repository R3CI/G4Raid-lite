# This code is not the best as i honestly dont care much about it its made to work well and i do not need it to be good code overall as i dont update this often
# Only the paid version will get updates often this is a side thing nothing crazy
# Remember this is literary the only up to date FREE tool out on github all the other ones are old or skids from 2023
# If you wana get more features with the cost of flgging ur stuff do but you will make ur tokens flagged
